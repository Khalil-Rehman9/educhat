Introduction
 
&
 
Problem
 
Statement
 
University
 
students,
 
particularly
 
in
 
rapidly
 
evolving
 
fields
 
like
 
Computer
 
Science,
 
AI,
 
and
 
Data
 
Science,
 
face
 
significant
 
academic
 
challenges.
 
These
 
include
 
managing
 
vast
 
amounts
 
of
 
information
 
from
 
diverse
 
sources
 
(lectures,
 
textbooks,
 
notes,
 
online
 
resources),
 
understanding
 
complex
 
concepts,
 
finding
 
timely
 
answers
 
to
 
specific
 
doubts,
 
and
 
effectively
 
preparing
 
for
 
assessments.
 
Current
 
study
 
methods
 
often
 
lack
 
personalization
 
and
 
immediate
 
feedback,
 
potentially
 
leading
 
to
 
knowledge
 
gaps
 
and
 
decreased
 
engagement.
 

--- Page 2 ---
Furthermore,
 
ensuring
 
consistent
 
understanding
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
HEC
 
curriculum
 
standards
 
across
 
various
 
course
 
materials
 
can
 
be
 
difficult
 
for
 
students
 
navigating
 
their
 
studies
 
independently.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
need
 
for
 
an
 
intelligent
 
tool
 
that
 
can
 
centralize
 
learning
 
resources,
 
provide
 
context-aware
 
assistance,
 
adapt
 
to
 
individual
 
learning
 
paces,
 
and
 
make
 
studying
 
more
 
interactive
 
and
 
effective.
 
This
 
project
 
directly
 
addresses
 
these
 
challenges
 
by
 
proposing
 
an
 
AI-driven
 
companion
 
that
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
personalized
 
tutor,
 
available
 
24/7,
 
capable
 
of
 
understanding
 
and
 
processing
 
student-specific
 
course
 
materials.

Proposed
 
Solution:
 
AI
 
Study
 
Companion
 
MVP
 
We
 
propose
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
an
 
AI-Powered
 
Study
 
Companion
 
MVP
 
–
 
a
 
web-based
 
application
 
built
 
using
 
Streamlit
 
for
 
accessibility
 
and
 
ease
 
of
 
use.
 
The
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
solution
 
lies
 
in
 
its
 
ability
 
to:
 
1.
 
Ingest
 
and
 
Understand
 
Diverse
 
Academic
 
Content:
 
Students
 
can
 
upload
 
materials
 
in
 
various
 
formats
 
(PDF,
 
DOCX,
 
PPTX,
 
images
 
of
 
notes/diagrams).
 
The
 
system
 
uses
 
advanced
 
AI
 
(GPT-4
 
with
 
Vision)
 
to
 
parse,
 
extract,
 
and
 
comprehend
 
this
 
content.
 
2.
 
Provide
 
Contextual
 
Interaction:
 
Through
 
a
 
chat
 
interface,
 
students
 
can
 
ask
 
questions,
 
request
 
summaries,
 
or
 
ask
 
for
 
explanations
 
related
 
to
 
their
 
uploaded
 
documents.
 
The
 
AI
 
maintains
 
context
 
within
 
the
 
conversation
 
and
 
the
 
provided
 
materials.
 
3.
 
Facilitate
 
Active
 
Recall
 
and
 
Assessment:
 
The
 
tool
 
can
 
automatically
 
generate
 
relevant
 
quizzes
 
(e.g.,
 
MCQs,
 
short
 
answer
 
prompts)
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
uploaded
 
content,
 
helping
 
students
 
test
 
their
 
understanding
 
and
 
prepare
 
for
 
exams.
 
4.
 
Align
 
with
 
HEC
 
Curriculum:
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
be
 
primed
 
with
 
knowledge
 
of
 
the
 
HEC
 
curriculum
 
outlines
 
for
 
CS,
 
AI,
 
and
 
DS
 
to
 
ensure
 
generated
 
content
 
and
 
explanations
 
are
 
relevant
 
and
 
accurate
 
within
 
the
 
local
 
academic
 
context.
 
This
 
MVP
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
foundational
 
step
 
towards
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
AI-driven
 
academic
 
support
 
system
 
for
 
the
 
university.
 
 
4.
 
Objectives
 
The
 
primary
 
objectives
 
of
 
this
 
MVP
 
phase
 
are:
 
1.
 
Develop
 
and
 
Deploy
 
a
 
Functional
 
MVP:
 
Create
 
a

AI
 
Study
 
Companion
 
accessible

pilot
 
group
 
of
 
CS,
 
AI,
 
and
 
DS
 
students.

Q&A,
 
quiz
 
generation,
 
context
 
recall,
 
simplified
 
explanations,
 
and
 
basic
 
progress
 
tracking.

using
 
HEC
 
curriculum
 
documents
 
for
 
CS,
 
AI,
 
and

Mechanism:
 
Utilizes
 
libraries
 
(PyMuPDF,
 
python-docx,
 
python-pptx)
 
for
 
text
 
extraction
 
from
 
documents
 
and
 
OpenAI's
 
GPT-4
 
Vision
 
API
 
for
 
analyzing

and
 
visual
 
understanding
 
models
 
extract

●
 
Functionality:
 
Enables
 
summarization,
 
Q&A,
 
and
 
quiz
 
generation
 
directly
 
from
 
visual
 
or
 
text-based
 
uploaded
 
materials.
 
●
 
Benefit:
 
Allows

to
 
use
 
their
 
preferred
 
study
 
materials,
 
regardless
 
of
 
format.
 
6.3
 
Advanced
 
Retrieval-Augmented
 
Generation
 
(RAG)
 
●
 
Mechanism:
 
Uploaded
 
documents
 
are
 
chunked,
 
converted
 
into
 
vector
 
embeddings
 
(using
 
OpenAI
 
Embeddings),
 
and
 
stored
 
in
 
a
 
vector
 
database
 
(FAISS
 
or
 
Supabase
 
Vector
 
Store).
 
When
 
a
 
user
 
asks
 
a
 
question,
 
the
 
system
 
retrieves
 
the
 
most
 
semantically
 
relevant
 
document
 
chunks
 
and
 
feeds
 
them,
 
along
 
with

directly
 
on
 
the
 
provided
 
course
 
materials.
 
6.4
 
Contextual
 
Q&A
 
with
 
Memory
 
●
 
Mechanism:
 
The
 
chatbot
 
maintains

session.
 
It
 
leverages
 
this
 
memory,
 
alongside
 
the
 
context
 
from
 
uploaded
 
documents,
 
to
 
understand
 
follow-up
 
questions,
 
resolve
 
ambiguities,
 
and
 
provide
 
coherent,
 
ongoing
 
assistance,
 
mimicking
 
a
 
tutor's
 
conversational
 
flow.
 
●
 
Benefit:
 
Creates
 
a
 
more
 
natural
 
and
 
effective

6.5
 
Automated
 
Quiz
 
Generator
 
●
 
Mechanism:
 
Students
 
can
 
select
 
uploaded
 
documents
 
or
 
specific
 
topics
 
within
 
them.
 
The
 
AI
 
analyzes
 
the
 
content
 
and
 
generates
 
relevant
 
quizzes
 
(MCQs,
 
True/False,
 
potentially
 
short
 
answer)
 
to
 
test
 
comprehension.
 
●
 
Benefit:
 
Promotes
 
active

●
 
 
●
 
Benefit:
 
Helps
 
students
 
organize
 
their

Conclusion
 
The
 
proposed
 
AI-Powered
 
Student
 
Study
 
Companion
 
represents
 
a
 
timely
 
and
 
strategic
 
initiative
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
academic
 
experience
 
at
 
IST.
 
By
 
leveraging
 
state
 
of
 
the
 
art
 
AI
 
technology
 
within
 
a
 
focused
 
MVP,
 
we
 
can
 
provide
 
immediate
 
value
 
to
 
students
 
in
 
key
 
technical
 
departments
 
while
 
establishing
 
a
 
foundation
 
for
 
future
 
innovation
 
in
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning
 
across
 
the
 
institution.
 
This
 
project
 
not
 
only
 
addresses
 
current
 
student
 
needs
 
for
 
personalized
 
and
 
accessible
 
academic
 
support
 
but
 
also
 
positions
 
the
 
university
 
at
 
the
 
forefront
 
of
 
educational
 
technology
 
adoption.
